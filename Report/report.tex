\subsection{Maximizing the spread of cascades - Greedy algorithm}

With a greedy algorithm our main focus was on optimising the cycle speed to facilitate the treatment of our dataset and not having to wait half an our to get only a few seeds.
One of the first hurdle was to make the algorithm deterministic instead of stochastic for consistency. For that we're using the \href{https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/random.html#random.seed}{random.seed} from python random library, which will give us consistent generated values.

The first implementation was relatively inefficient. The cascades were calculated from scratch for each nodes each time we were trying to determine the highest spreading node.
